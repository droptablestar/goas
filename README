Welcomg to GOAS a compiler for optimized algebraic queries.

This is the root directory of the project.

To install [currently on supported on OS X]:


In the src/ directory of each version are the .c files that make up the parser
as well as the .c files that make up the different operators. These are all
bundled together in the library found in the lib/ directory. The include/
directory contains all of the .h files that need to be included to execute
queries.

To run a query for any of the goas variants cd into the top level directory of
that variant. This will be the directory where src/ lib/ and include/ are all
visible. A sample query will look as follows:

./goas ../testing/oas_queries/scan/100k_scan [This will compile the query.]
./temp [This will execute the query.]

For executing postgres queries a postgres server with a username postgres must
be available. This is left up to the user to handle. When this is set up cd
into any of the query directory and execute the desired file.

From scratch the system is built as follows
make bin/par
make lib/liboas

At this point queries can be executed as described previously.

A number of sample queries are available in oas_queries/ and pgres_queries
that rely on tables found in oas_tables/ and pgres tables/, respectively.
To generate tables for oas from the testing/ directory:

javac OASGen.java
java OASGen <table-name> <number-of-tuples> > oas_tables/<table-name>

Example (100,000 records):
java OASGen 100k 100000 > oas_tables/100k
