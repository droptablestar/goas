In this directory you will find the various different versions of the goas
compiler.

oas: This is the original version.
oas_mmap: This version using memory mapping.
oas_omp: This version uses OpenMP

checker-267: This directory contains some executables used for code analysis.
testing: In here are all items used in the evaluation of the project.
	 Including queries that were executed and the tables they were run on.

In the src/ directory of each version are the .c files that make up the parser
as well as the .c files that make up the different operators. These are all
bundled together in the library found in the lib/ directory. The include/
directory contains all of the .h files that need to be included to execute
queries.

To run a query for any of the goas variants cd into the top level directory of
that variant. This will be the directory where src/ lib/ and include/ are all
visible. A sample query will look as follows:

./goas ../testing/oas_queries/scan/100k_scan [This will compile the query.]
./temp [This will execute the query.]

For executing postgres queries a postgres server with a username postgres must
be available. This is left up to the user to handle. When this is set up cd
into any of the query directory and execute the desired file.
